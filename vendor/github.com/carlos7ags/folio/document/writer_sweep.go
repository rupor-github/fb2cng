// sweepOrphans drops any indirect object that is not reachable from the
// document roots and renumbers the survivors contiguously starting at 1.
//
// The reachability roots are the trailer entries: /Root, /Info, and
// /Encrypt (ISO 32000-1 §7.5.5). The walk follows every PdfIndirectReference
// nested inside a reachable object's value graph (dictionaries, arrays,
// stream dictionaries). Reaching an object number that does not correspond
// to a registered indirect object is treated as a dangling reference —
// allowed by §7.3.10 ("a reference to an unknown object is a reference
// to the null object") — and ignored.
//
// The sweep mutates Writer state in place:
//
//   - w.objects is replaced with the kept slice in original order, with
//     ObjectNumber rewritten to the new contiguous numbering.
//   - Every PdfIndirectReference inside a kept object's body is rewritten
//     so its ObjectNumber matches the new numbering.
//   - The root references themselves (w.root, w.info, w.encryptRef) are
//     rewritten in place. Because *PdfIndirectReference is shared by
//     pointer between the Writer's trailer slot and the embedding object's
//     value graph, a single rewrite updates both observers.
//
// The sweep is a no-op when every registered object is reachable. It is
// idempotent: calling it twice produces the same w.objects as calling it
// once. It is unconditionally lossless on size — the kept set is a subset
// of the input set and individual object bodies are not modified.
//
// Encrypted documents are refused upstream in WriteToWithOptions because
// the standard security handler keys each object on its number
// (§7.6.3.3); renumbering would invalidate every encryption key.
